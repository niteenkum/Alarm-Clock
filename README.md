# Alarm-Clock

I created This project using Vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

I created a design of mobile alarm view.

When you click on + button you will have a time text box and AM/PM option to select and create a new alarm.

After Adding Alarm if you will click on Right button it will redirect your to main page and the alarm tile will be added and If you click on cross button it will redirect you to main page without adding the alarm tile.

There is two option if you just want to switch off the alarm you can switch off it via clicking on button or if you want to delete the alarm will be deleted.
